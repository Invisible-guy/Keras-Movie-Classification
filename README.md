# Keras Movie Classification

This is an project about reading Movie Reviews, we use machine learning through the help of keras, a subset of tenslorflow. This gives an output from 1 to 0, with 1 being a positive output , and 0 being negative output. 

## Installation

Open it like you normally would, extract the git file or edit it with your codespace. This requires keras, numpy, and a little bit of ssl. This requries a version of python that is quite recent too.


## What to do?

I would be happy if even a small contribution is made, this wil make us a better, more well-rounded programmer society!


## Guidelines

The fashion_mnist py file is just a small demo I used when I was watching tutorials of TechwitTim, it's a basic setup of the movie classification.

## Problems

There are many problems and faulty code in this project, it would be helpful for suggestions, of any sort!
